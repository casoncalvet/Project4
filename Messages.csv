When I open my eyes, I see you. There is nothing I can do without thinking of you.\n\nI don’t even know how to tell you how much I love you.

I feel like the words I say to you are so much more real than anything I’ve ever said to anyone else. You put color into my world. I feel like I’ve become a better person because of you, better able to love and care for other people in my life.

Maybe I deserve that. \nI know you want more children, do you not want them with me anymore, do you not want to be a family anymore, down the road do you not see us in the same house with our child. I need to know why you’re so distant with me now and why you treat me so bad now. Are you seeing someone, are you talking to someone, do you not think of me anymore, do you not miss me.
